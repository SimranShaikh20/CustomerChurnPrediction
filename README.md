# CustomerChurnPrediction
Customer churn prediction is to measure why customers are leaving a business. In this tutorial we will be looking at customer churn in telecom business. We will build a deep learning model to predict the churn and use precision,recall, f1-score to measure performance of our model.


## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using deep learning techniques. Customer churn, which measures why customers are leaving a business, is a critical metric for companies to understand and address.

## Objectives
- Analyze customer churn patterns in the telecom business
- Build a deep learning model to predict customer churn
- Evaluate the model's performance using precision, recall, and f1-score metrics

## Implementation
Our approach includes:
- Collecting and preprocessing telecom customer data
- Developing a deep learning model for churn prediction
- Training and validating the model using appropriate datasets
- Evaluating the model's performance using precision, recall, and f1-score

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Deep Learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch)
- Data analysis and visualization tools

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering tailored for telecom customer data
- Implementation of a deep learning model for churn prediction
- Comprehensive evaluation using multiple performance metrics

## Why This Matters
Understanding and predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses, especially in the competitive telecom industry. By accurately identifying potential churners, companies can:
- Implement targeted retention strategies
- Improve customer satisfaction and loyalty
- Optimize resources by focusing on at-risk customers

## Results
The project demonstrates the effective application of deep learning in predicting customer churn. Detailed results, including model performance metrics, are available in the project files.
